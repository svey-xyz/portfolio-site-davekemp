    <p><span class="italic">Image Matter</span> is an 
      artistic project produced through collaboration 
      between Dave Kemp (a visual artist) and Kevin 
      Robbie (a physicist specializing in nanostructured 
      materials) that investigates the nature of value 
      and new forms of value resulting from advances 
      in digital technologies, specifically as related 
      to photographic images. </p>
    <p>The project makes use of a scanning electron 
      microscope (SEM) to image a variety of photographic 
      materials edge-on. By displaying the edge view 
      (thickness) of the photographic material on a 
      very large scale, the physicality of the photograph 
      is emphasized and all trace of the image contained 
      within the photograph is eliminated. The only 
      reference to the image content is through the 
      use of captions and associated text. By removing 
      the image, the viewer is left to consider the 
      photograph on new grounds, as both a photographic 
      object and a photographic image and to establish 
      where different forms of value attributed to photographs 
      actually exist. </p>
    <p>Value as attributed to a photograph can manifest 
      itself in a variety of ways, from straightforward 
      use-value and market-value, to the significance 
      attributed to the memory of a loved one or of 
      times past. Value can also be assessed through 
      Walter Benjamin's notion of cult-value and exhibition-value 
      and even through Benjamin's concept of <span class="italic">aura</span>. 
      Although this property was not originally attributed 
      to photographs, one could argue that over the 
      years, certain photographs, particularly vintage 
      photographs do in fact develop a "unique existence 
      in time and space" (Benjamin, 1978, p 220) and 
      display "changes which it may have suffered in 
      physical condition over the years as well as the 
      various changes in ownership" (Benjamin, 1978, 
      p 220) as with the case of the included military 
      identification photograph that has quite literally 
      been through World War II. </p>
    <p>Thanks to the support of the Project Open Source 
      Open Access initiative at the University of Toronto, 
      an online, digital version of this project will 
      be made available under a <span class="italic">Creative 
      Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License</span>. 
      Releasing the artwork in this manner will result 
      in wider distribution and a much larger audience 
      than could be achieved through a physical gallery 
      exhibition. It will allow individuals to download, 
      print and thus own a copy of the artwork (at no 
      cost to the creators of the artwork) and allows 
      for the images to be used as building blocks by 
      other artists. Ideally, this project may help 
      to set a precedent for other artists to release 
      work in a similar fashion.</p>
